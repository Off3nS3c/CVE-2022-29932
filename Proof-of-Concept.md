## **Proof-of-Concept (POC)**

Navigating the website without any kind of credentials and executing fuzzing on the root directory, it has been observed web resources built at real-time.

After an in-depth analysis it was observed that those resources are strictly related to already existent data directories on the web server.
Creating a crafted HTTP request pointing to these data directories cutting the trailing "/" character, the web server answers an unmanaged memory leak in HTTP response.
As an example we created two folders on the webserver called "assets" and "pippo" in order to reproduce the unsecure behaviour obtaining the memory leak.

By downloading or navigating the resource containing the memory leak, it has been possible to navigate the exfiltrated buffer of memory which contained the content of exchanged files by authorized users leading to an information leakage.
